# üîç Suspicious Unicode Character Detector

**Suspicious Unicode Character Detector** is a browser-based tool designed to identify potentially deceptive Unicode characters in text. This specialized security tool helps detect hidden characters, homoglyphs, and other special symbols that could be exploited in phishing attacks, URL spoofing, or other security threats. The tool scans input text for non-standard characters, providing real-time feedback to ensure the safety and integrity of your data.

## üîç Key Features

- **Hidden Character Detection:** Identify zero-width and invisible Unicode characters that might be used to obfuscate text or URLs.
- **Homoglyph Identification:** Spot characters that visually resemble standard ASCII characters but are actually different Unicode characters, making them ideal for deceptive purposes.
- **Character Classification:** Automatically categorize suspicious characters by type (e.g., homoglyphs, invisible characters).
- **Visual Analysis:** Results are color-coded for easy identification and understanding, with character counts and detailed descriptions.
- **Unicode Code Point Display:** Each suspicious character's Unicode code point is shown in the format **U+XXXX**, making the detection process more transparent.
- **Real-Time Scanning:** Get instant feedback as text is analyzed, with immediate identification of potential threats.
- **Character Count Statistics:** Track occurrences of each suspicious character type across the analyzed text, offering deeper insights into potential issues.

## üìä Output Information

The tool provides the following analysis:

- **Overall Security Assessment:** A general evaluation of the text‚Äôs security based on detected issues.
- **Suspicious Characters List:** A detailed list of all suspicious characters found in the input text.
- **Unicode Code Points:** Displays the Unicode code points for each detected character in **U+XXXX** format.
- **Character Type Classification:** Classifies detected characters into categories (e.g., homoglyphs, invisible characters).
- **Character Occurrences:** A count of how many times each suspicious character appears in the text.
- **Visual Representation:** Color-coded highlighting to visually separate different types of suspicious characters for easier review.

## üîß Technical Details

The detector works by performing the following operations:

- **Scans Text Against Unicode Ranges:** The tool scans input text for characters outside the standard ASCII range (0x00-0x7F).
- **Targets Problematic Unicode Ranges:** Specifically looks for:
    - **Zero-width characters (U+200B to U+200D):** These characters are invisible and can be used to obfuscate URLs or text.
    - **Control characters (U+2060 to U+206F):** Non-printing characters that may affect how text is displayed or interpreted.
    - **Byte Order Mark (U+FEFF):** A special character used to indicate byte order in text encoding, which could be malicious if placed incorrectly.
    - **Full-width characters (U+FF00 to U+FFFF):** Characters that are wider than standard ASCII characters, often used to disguise malicious links.
- **Creates Detailed Reports:** After scanning, a comprehensive report is generated, listing all detected suspicious characters, their Unicode code points, and their types.

## üéì Security Value

This tool serves as both a practical utility and a valuable security resource:

- **Phishing Prevention:** Helps identify potential phishing attempts by detecting invisible characters in URLs or email addresses.
- **URL Spoofing Detection:** Flags deceptive characters that could be used to disguise malicious URLs in phishing campaigns.
- **Secure Copy/Paste Operations:** Protects against hidden characters that could be inadvertently copied and pasted, potentially introducing vulnerabilities.
- **Unicode Security Education:** Educates users about the risks of deceptive Unicode characters and how they can be used for social engineering attacks.
- **Forensic Text Analysis:** Aids in the forensic analysis of suspicious text in cybersecurity investigations, helping experts identify and mitigate threats.
