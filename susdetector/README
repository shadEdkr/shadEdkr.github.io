A specialized security tool designed to identify potentially deceptive Unicode characters in text. This browser-based utility helps users detect hidden characters, homoglyphs, and other special symbols that could be used in phishing attacks, URL spoofing, or other security threats.
🔍 Features

Hidden Character Detection - Identify zero-width and invisible Unicode characters
Homoglyph Identification - Spot characters that visually resemble standard ASCII but are different
Character Classification - Automatically categorize suspicious characters by type
Visual Analysis - Color-coded results with character counts and descriptions
Code Point Display - Show Unicode code points for each suspicious character
Real-time Scanning - Instant feedback as text is analyzed
Character Count Statistics - Track occurrences of each suspicious character type

💻 Technical Implementation

Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript - No external libraries or dependencies required
Regular Expression Pattern Matching - Efficient detection of non-standard characters
Unicode Range Analysis - Targeted detection of specific problematic Unicode ranges
Responsive Design - Clean interface that works across devices
Client-side Processing - All analysis performed locally in the browser

🚀 How to Use

Enter or paste text into the input area
Click "Scan for Hidden Characters" or press Enter
Review the highlighted results
Examine detailed character information for any detected issues

📊 Output Information
The tool provides the following analysis:

Overall security assessment of the text
Detailed list of suspicious characters detected
Unicode code point for each character (U+XXXX format)
Character type classification and description
Count of occurrences for each suspicious character
Visual representation with color-coding by character type

🔧 Technical Details
The detector performs the following operations:

Scans input text against predetermined Unicode ranges
Detects characters outside standard ASCII (0x00-0x7F)
Specifically targets problematic ranges such as:

Zero-width characters (U+200B through U+200D)
Control characters (U+2060 through U+206F)
Byte Order Mark (U+FEFF)
Full-width characters (U+FF00 through U+FFFF)


Creates a comprehensive report of all findings

🎓 Security Value
This tool serves as both a practical utility and a security resource:

Helps identify potential phishing attempts
Reveals hidden characters in URLs and domains
Supports secure copy/paste operations by revealing hidden content
Educates users about Unicode security issues
Assists in forensic analysis of suspicious text
