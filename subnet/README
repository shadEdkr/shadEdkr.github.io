Subnet LEGO Visualizer 🌐
Overview
A user-friendly, visual subnet calculator tool designed to help network administrators, cybersecurity professionals, and students understand IP addressing and subnetting concepts. This web-based utility provides real-time visualization of subnet components using a LEGO-like block representation.
🔍 Features

IP Address Analysis - Parse and validate IPv4 addresses
Subnet Mask Visualization - Convert between decimal and binary representations
Network Address Calculation - Automatically determine network address based on IP and subnet mask
Host Range Identification - Calculate first and last usable host addresses
Binary Visualization - Color-coded bit representation showing network and host portions
CIDR Notation Support - Display subnet information in Classless Inter-Domain Routing format
Usable Hosts Calculation - Determine the number of available hosts in a subnet

💻 Technical Implementation

Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript - No external libraries or dependencies required
Responsive Design - Clean and intuitive interface that works across devices
Visual Learning Approach - Color-coded bit visualization to enhance understanding
Real-time Calculations - Instant feedback as users modify inputs

🚀 How to Use

Enter a host IP address (default: 192.168.1.100)
Enter a subnet mask (default: 255.255.255.0)
Click "Visualize Subnet" to generate the analysis
View the network information and binary visualization results

📊 Output Information
The tool provides the following information:

Complete IP address analysis
Subnet mask in decimal and CIDR notation
Network address
First and last usable host addresses
Broadcast address
Number of usable hosts
Binary visualization of both IP address and subnet mask with color-coded bit representation

🔧 Technical Details
The calculator performs the following operations:

Converts decimal IP and subnet values to binary
Performs bitwise operations to calculate network and broadcast addresses
Uses color-coding to distinguish between network bits (blue) and host bits (red)
Provides a visual representation of the 32-bit structure with octet separators

🎓 Educational Value
This tool serves as both a practical utility and an educational resource:

Helps students understand the relationship between IP addresses and subnet masks
Visualizes the binary nature of IP addressing
Demonstrates how network and host portions are determined
Supports learning of subnetting concepts through interactive visualization

💾 Installation

Download the HTML file
Open it in any modern web browser
No server or installation required - works completely client-side

🔜 Future Enhancements
Potential future features may include:

Subnet splitting/planning tools
Support for IPv6 addresses
Custom network visualization
Exportable results
Subnet practice exercises
