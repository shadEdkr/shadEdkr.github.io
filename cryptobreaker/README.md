# üîì CryptoBreaker - Decryption Tool

**CryptoBreaker** is an advanced decryption tool designed to decrypt and crack various encryption methods. Whether you're looking to decrypt simple methods like Base64 and Caesar cipher or more complex ones like AES and RSA, this tool is built to help you break through various encryption techniques.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Decrypt and Crack Multiple Methods:** 
  - Base64
  - Caesar Cipher
  - ROT13
  - URL Encoding
  - Hexadecimal
  - Binary
  - Morse Code
  - Atbash Cipher
  - AES (Requires Key)
  - RSA (Requires Key)

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design to easily switch between decryption methods and view results.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Text is processed as soon as it's entered, with output displayed instantly.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Easily copy decrypted text with a single click.

## üìã How It Works

1. **Select the Decryption Method:** Choose from a variety of encryption methods in the dropdown.
2. **Enter Encrypted Text:** Paste or type the encrypted text into the input field.
3. **Enter Key (for AES/RSA):** If you're using AES or RSA, enter the decryption key in the password field.
4. **Decrypt Text:** Click on the "Decrypt / Crack Text" button to start the decryption process.
5. **View Results:** The decrypted output will appear below, and you can easily copy it to the clipboard.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Supported Encryption Methods

### **Easy Decryption Methods**
- **Base64**: For encoding/decoding binary data.
- **Caesar Cipher**: A shift cipher that moves letters by a fixed number of positions.
- **ROT13**: A special case of Caesar cipher with a 13-position shift.
- **URL Encoding**: Percent-encoding used in URLs.
- **Hexadecimal**: Base-16 number system representation.
- **Binary**: Base-2 binary representation.
- **Morse Code**: Dots and dashes telegraph code.
- **Atbash Cipher**: Hebrew cipher that reverses the alphabet.

### **Hard Decryption Methods** (Requires Key)
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: Symmetric encryption that requires a decryption key.
- **RSA (Public-Key Cryptography)**: Asymmetric encryption that requires a private key for decryption.

## üì• How to Use

1. **Choose the Decryption Method:**
   - From the dropdown menu, select the decryption method you wish to use.
   
2. **Enter Encrypted Text:**
   - Paste or type the encrypted text in the provided text area.

3. **Enter Key (Optional for AES/RSA):**
   - If you're using AES or RSA, enter the required decryption key in the password input field.

4. **Click "Decrypt / Crack Text":**
   - Click the button to start the decryption process. The results will be displayed immediately.

5. **Copy the Decrypted Text:**
   - Once decryption is complete, the decrypted text will appear below. You can copy it to the clipboard with a simple click.

## üí° Example Use Case

- **Base64 Decryption:**
  - Input: `U29tZSBzYW1wbGUgdGV4dA==`
  - Output: `Some sample text`

- **Caesar Cipher:**
  - Input: `Uif tfdsfu dpef`
  - Output: `The secret code`

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Tabbed Navigation:** Easily switch between "Decrypt & Crack" and "Encryption Methods" tabs.
- **Interactive Results:** Decrypted text displayed in a text area with the option to copy to clipboard.
- **Toast Notifications:** Informative pop-ups for successful actions and errors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

No installation required. Just open the HTML file in your browser and start decrypting text immediately.
